# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (PHP)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future PHP projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/php-data2table
  cd php-data2table
  php data2table.php
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal*
